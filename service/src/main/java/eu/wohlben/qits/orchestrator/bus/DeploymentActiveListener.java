/**
 * <b>A deployment is live, so what it superseded is collectable.</b> This service's first — and so
 * far only — consumption of the platform's event bus.
 *
 * <p>What it does is one call, {@link GcDeployTrigger#onDeploymentActive}, and every decision behind
 * it (the trailing-edge debounce, the two gates, never a dry run, what a busy executor means) is
 * stated there. This class is the seam: decode, hand over.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a deployment at all.</b> The gc cron is a clock, and a clock is a guess about when there
 * is something to collect. A deployment is the fact — the predecessor container's image and every
 * registry identity the release it carried superseded stop being referenced at exactly that moment —
 * and until this listener existed those bytes waited for 03:00 the next day for no reason but the
 * schedule. The cron stays, unchanged, as the backstop.
 *
 * <h2>The payload is a LOCAL record, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut</h2>
 *
 * <p>qits-deployments publishes a vocabulary jar — {@code qits-platform-deployments-events}, which
 * carries the real {@code DeploymentActive} — and this service does not depend on it, for the reason
 * this repository's first rule gives: a clone builds and tests green on its own, and a jar the
 * platform's Maven registry does not serve is a build that resolves out of somebody's {@code ~/.m2}
 * and fails in a release pipeline's step container. That registry serves nothing under that
 * coordinate (measured 2026-09-03 from qits-projects, which reached the same answer). So the payload
 * is bound into a local record by {@link CanonicalJson}, the platform's standing answer for a
 * cross-repo event.
 *
 * <p>The cost is honest and is the cost every cross-repo contract carries: a rename over there is
 * silent here. What makes it survivable is that the wire name is a signature string on both sides
 * and the fields are named in one place, so a change at least has to be a diff.
 *
 * <h2>Failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>The seam's rule — {@link #onFrame} runs inside the transaction that claims the event, so a
 * throw rolls the claim back and the event is owed forever. <b>Nothing here throws.</b> A payload
 * that will not read is poison: the same bytes would fail identically on every later offer, so it is
 * a WARN and a return, which settles it. And the handover itself cannot fail — arming a timer is
 * memory and a schedule, and the run it eventually starts runs on the timer's own thread, well
 * outside this transaction. A gc run must never be inside the claim of the event that asked for it:
 * it is minutes of other people's deleting, and it would hold both this transaction and this
 * consumer's watermark for the whole of it.
 *
 * <h2>Where it starts reading</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #replayFromEpoch()} is left at its default, which is the head of the log, and it is a
 * choice rather than an omission: a brand-new consumer replaying from the epoch would walk every
 * deployment this platform has ever made and arm a collection for each one — hundreds of events,
 * every one of them long since superseded by the next, collapsing into one run that would have
 * happened tonight anyway. "From now on, a deployment causes a collection" is exactly the semantics
 * wanted.
