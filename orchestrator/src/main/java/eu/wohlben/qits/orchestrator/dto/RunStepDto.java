/**
 * One step of one RUN, as {@code GET /runs/{id}} serves it: the definition's fields plus what
 * happened.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code response} is a STRING carrying the peer's JSON text</b>, bounded at 1 MiB with a
 * marker appended past it. It is served as the bytes that arrived rather than as an embedded
 * object, for two reasons: a truncated document is not parseable JSON and would have nowhere to go
 * in an object-typed field, and a re-serialisation would be this service's opinion about another
 * service's answer. A client that wants the tree parses the string and copes with a body that does
 * not parse.
 *
 * @param id the step id from the definition, NOT the storage row's uuid
 * @param name the human line
 * @param target the peer
 * @param dependsOn the step ids it waited for, as the definition had them when the run opened
 * @param status PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED or SKIPPED
 * @param startedAt when it began, or null if it never did
 * @param finishedAt when it ended, or null
 * @param httpStatus the peer's status code, or null when there was none
 * @param request what was sent, or null for a step that sent nothing
 * @param response the peer's body as text, or null
 * @param error why it failed or why it was skipped, or null
 * @param summary the one human line, or null
